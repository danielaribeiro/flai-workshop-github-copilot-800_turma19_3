Description: Update Django project files for octofit-tracker app

# Django App Updates

- All Django project files are in the `octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker` directory.

1. Update `settings.py` for MongoDB connection and CORS. And make sure `octofit_tracker`, `rest_framework`, and `djongo` are in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Update `models.py`, `serializers.py`, `urls.py`, `views.py`, `tests.py`, and `admin.py` to support users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
3. Ensure `/` points to the api and `api_root` is present in `urls.py`. (See attachments above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)


# Notes
- Use the existing Django project layout under `octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker`.
- Prefer Django REST Framework patterns for serializers and views.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with the existing codebase style.
- Add tests in `tests.py` to validate basic CRUD for each collection.
